# Testing Strategy for Journly Blog Platform

This document outlines the testing approach for the Journly blog platform.

## Testing Levels

We use a three-tiered testing approach:

1. **Unit Testing**: Testing individual functions and components in isolation
2. **Integration Testing**: Testing interactions between components and API endpoints
3. **End-to-End Testing**: Testing complete user flows from the UI to the database

## Testing Tools

- **Jest**: For unit and integration testing
- **React Testing Library**: For testing React components
- **Playwright**: For end-to-end testing

```

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Run end-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run end-to-end tests with UI
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

## Writing Tests

### Unit Tests

Unit tests should focus on testing a single function or component in isolation. Use mocks for dependencies.

Example:

```typescript
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import Button from '@/components/Button';

describe('Button', () => {
  it('renders correctly', () => {
    render(<Button>Click me</Button>);
    expect(screen.getByRole('button')).toHaveTextContent('Click me');
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests

Integration tests should focus on testing interactions between components or API endpoints.

Example:

```typescript
import { render, screen, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';
import LoginForm from '@/components/LoginForm';

describe('LoginForm', () => {
  it('submits the form and redirects on success', async () => {
    render(<LoginForm />);
    
    await userEvent.type(screen.getByLabelText(/email/i), 'test@example.com');
    await userEvent.type(screen.getByLabelText(/password/i), 'password123');
    await userEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: /sign in/i }));
    
    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(window.location.pathname).toBe('/dashboard');
    });
  });
});
```

### End-to-End Tests

End-to-end tests should focus on testing complete user flows.

Example:

```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('user can log in and create a post', async ({ page }) => {
  // Log in
  await page.goto('/login');
  await page.fill('input[name="email"]', 'test@example.com');
  await page.fill('input[name="password"]', 'password123');
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]');
  
  // Navigate to create post page
  await page.click('text=New Post');
  
  // Fill in post details
  await page.fill('input[name="title"]', 'Test Post');
  await page.fill('div[contenteditable="true"]', 'This is a test post');
  await page.click('button:has-text("Publish")');
  
  // Verify post was created
  await expect(page).toHaveURL(/.*dashboard\/posts/);
  await expect(page.locator('text=Test Post')).toBeVisible();
});
```

## Test Coverage

We aim for high test coverage, but focus on critical paths and components. The following areas should have comprehensive test coverage:

- Authentication flows
- Post creation and management
- User profile management
- API endpoints

## Continuous Integration

Tests are run automatically on pull requests and before deployment to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

## Mocking

We use Jest's mocking capabilities to mock dependencies in unit and integration tests. For API tests, we mock the database and external services.

## Test Data

We use a separate test database for integration and end-to-end tests. The test database is seeded with test data before running tests.

## Best Practices

1. Write tests that are independent and can run in any order
2. Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
3. Focus on testing behavior, not implementation details
4. Keep tests simple and focused on a single aspect
5. Use setup and teardown to avoid duplication
6. Use mocks judiciously to isolate the code being tested
